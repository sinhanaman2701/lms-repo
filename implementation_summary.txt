# LMS Home Screen Background Update - Implementation Summary

Date: 2026-02-24

## Objective
Change the background color of the LMS repository's home screen to white and ensure the application runs properly.

## Actions Taken
1. **Repository Access**: Utilized the `repos_workspace.json` configuration to navigate to the local `lms-repo` repository within the `dev-agent` workspace.
2. **Code Modification**: 
   - Modified `src/app/page.tsx` in `lms-repo`.
   - Changed the main background classes from `bg-[#0A0A0B]` (dark mode) to `bg-white` (light mode).
   - Adjusted text colors for contrast, changing the text wrapper from `text-white` to `text-black`.
   - Updated the header text gradient from `from-white` to `from-black`.
3. **Environment Setup**: 
   - Discovered that Node.js and Homebrew were missing on the local machine.
   - Installed `Homebrew` successfully.
   - Used Homebrew to install `Node.js` (`brew install node`).
   - Sourced the Homebrew environment variables into the shell setup.
4. **Local Testing**:
   - Ran `npm install` inside the `lms-repo` directory to install Next.js dependencies.
   - Started the Next.js development server using `npm run dev` (currently running on port 3001).
